![alt text](Screenshots/{F155EC3A-98AC-4C9B-B3FC-A3EE3BA0004F}.png)

### üîÑ How It Works  
- Access the mod via **MCM** in game
- **Book Reassignment Tab:**
    - Temporarily removes **Twisted Binding**  
    - Moves the book to your selected character  
    - Optionally marks it as **successfully read** to allow progression in the **Search the Cellar** Quest
- **Danse Macabre Tab:**
    - Allows adding or removing the **Danse Macabre** spell for selected characters.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Tested in Act 3**:
  Before speaking to **Mystic Carrion**, the book was initially assigned to **Tav** and was successfully reassigned to **Karlach, Shadowheart, Astarion, Lae'zel, Jaheira, Gale, and Wyll**.
- **SAVE BEFORE USING:**  
  This mod has only been tested as described above. The **Necromancy of Thay** can be in many different states depending on your gameplay choices.
- **Cutoff Point:**  
  This mod **may not help** if you haven't fulfilled the book's requirements before the cutoff point in **Act 3**.
- **Conflicting mods:**  
  Make sure to temporarily disable any Inventory-sorting mods that can affect **Necromancy of Thay** (e.g., **Bags, Bags, Bags**, which auto sort books)
